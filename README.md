* Step 0:


we need the data set as an excel file to generate the graph, but for now, since the data is not a big issue and we just want to check the algorithm, we are using Quantum Random number generatr to create the seed. 

The first python quantum code, which is called step0_generate_random generate the text file, which is used as our initial seed to create a random excel file.

* Step 1:

we can use the previous generated seed to creat the excel file, the excel file is called sensor.xlsx
