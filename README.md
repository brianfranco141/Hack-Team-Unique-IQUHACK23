* Step 0:


we need the data set as an excel file to generate the graph, but for now, since the data is not a big issue and we just want to check the algorithm, we are using Quantum Random number generatr to create the seed. 

The first python quantum code, which is called step0_generate_random generate the text file, which is used as our initial seed to create a random excel file.

* Step 1:

we can use the previous generated seed to creat the excel file, the excel file is called sensor.xlsx

also the value.txt is the input file where you can determine how your cost function values should be

the cost_function code will simulate different cost function based on all the different criteria that you find, each criteria can be activated with a flag that you can issue. So after changing each flag, you can go on and see the matrix, this way you can decide weather it is an acceptable graph or you need to filter further.
